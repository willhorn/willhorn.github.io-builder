Welcome! Thanks for stopping by.

In April, 2016 I decided to start on a focused learning path. I've been taking massive online open courses (MOOCs) for several years now, but there has not been a common thread or goal tying the courses together. Furthermore, the classes did not inspire much work beyond the requirements for course completion.

My current long-term goal is to complete a website I've been thinking about for a couple of years. To build the skills necessary to achieve this goal, I'll be doing coursework and small side projects. You can track my progress on the [goals page](goals.html). You can also see the results of some of my side projects in the blog section.

The primary purpose of this site is to serve as a reference for myself and those encouraging me on this journey, but I hope others find some value in it as well.
